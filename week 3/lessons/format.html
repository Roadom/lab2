<h1 class="lesson">Formatting and Style</h1>
<p>Lesson 2 is all about formatting. From CSS, divs, classes, ids and responsiveness, it has been discussed
in this chapter.</p>
<h2>There are different kinds of headings</h2>
<h3>For different kinds of uses</h3>
<h5>So make sure to choose wisely!</h5>

<p>Formatting with CSS is important to shape your elements into whatever you want.</p>
<div><h2>Divs can be used to group sections of elements together</h2>
<p>When combined with CSS, you can select certain portions of your website to format.</p></div>
<div class = "stuff">
<h2>Classes and IDs</h2>
<p>Classes and ID's are often used when pointing to a certain class name in a stylesheet. In Javascript, it can also be used to modify elements with the same class name. 
This heading and paragraph covered in blue is inside a div with a class name! Using IDs is similar but remember than it can only be used by one specific element.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="responsive">Responsiveness</h2>
<p class = "responsive">When adjusting the screem, responsive elements also adjust.</p>
