    <p>To be honest, I don't really have a lot to say about myself but what I do like to talk about are my interests. I am very passionate about my interests because 
      these really are the only things I do when I have free time. I also spend my time with these hobbies to relieve stress from various sources.<p>

  <h1>VIDEO GAMES</h1>
  <p>From childhood until now, video games have always been by my side. I love spending my time playing video games because it lets me escape our boring reality.
  From indie and casual games to competitive multiplayer games, I have experience playing them all. Hit me up if you recognize these games or if you are interested in
  games of similar genres and maybe we can talk about stuff or even play together!

  <h1>TV SHOWS AND MOVIES</h1>
  <p>When I'm not spending my time playing video games, I'm almost guaranteed to be watching TV shows or movies. I've watched a ton of shows and movies and I'm not really picky when choosing
    what to watch (it doesn't matter if it's bad as long as it's entertaining). Here are some of my favorite shows and movies that I've watched!

  <h1>COMPUTERS</h1>
  <p>Well, of course I'm interested in computers! We had a pretty old family computer which I always used to play games even though it was a suboptimal system for that purpose.
    Since it was ancient, it was always breaking down but because of my <del>addiction</del> passion for video games, I learned a lot of ways to fix various problems that our
    computer had. That's when my interest in computers began!
